The point of\r\n        using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of\r\n        letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it\r\n        look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web\r\n        page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a\r\n        search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their\r\n        infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by\r\n        accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\r\n      </Paragraph>\r\n\r\n      <H1 mt={4}>Who We Are and How To Contact Us</H1>\r\n      <Paragraph lineHeight={2} textAlign=\"justify\">\r\n        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing\r\n        pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete\r\n        account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great\r\n        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one\r\n        rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,\r\n        but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally\r\n        encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there\r\n        anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because\r\n        it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil\r\n        and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,\r\n        which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to\r\n        obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with\r\n        a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,\r\n        or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\r\n      </Paragraph>\r\n      <Paragraph mt={2} lineHeight={2} textAlign=\"justify\">\r\n        If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has\r\n        provided personal data to Vercel through the Platform, please contact\r\n        privacy@vercel.com and we will endeavor to delete that information from\r\n        our databases.\r\n      </Paragraph>\r\n\r\n      <H1 mt={4}>Children's Privacy</H1>\r\n      <Paragraph lineHeight={2} textAlign=\"justify\">\r\n        At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui\r\n        blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores\r\n        et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident,\r\n        similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est\r\n        laborum et dolorum fuga.
